# credit-card-fraud-detection
This dataset **(download available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithanacredit-card-fraud-detection-dataset-2023))** contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders in 2023. It comprises over 550,000 records, and the data has been anonymized to protect the cardholders' identities.

I built machine learning models with over 99% accuracy to detect and prevent credit card fraud by identifying suspicious transactions based on the provided features:
* **id**: Unique identifier for each transaction
* **V1-V28**: Anonymized features representing various transaction attributes (e.g., time, location, etc.)
* **Amount**: The transaction amount
* **Class**: Binary label indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0)
